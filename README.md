## What is Logging?
Logging is the process of recording information about the operation of a system.
Logs can provide insights into the applicationâ€™s behavior, including errors, warnings, and informational events. 
They help developers monitor, troubleshoot, and understand the performance and issues within an application.


## Why Logging is Important
# Logging is crucial because it:

Helps in debugging and identifying issues in the application.
Provides a historical record of application activities.
Aids in monitoring the health and performance of the application.
Assists in security by tracking access and changes to the system.

##  Understanding Logging Levels
Logging levels are used to categorize the importance or severity of the log messages. 

# Common logging levels include:

TRACE: Very detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
DEBUG: Detailed information on the flow through the system.
INFO: Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application.
WARN: Potentially harmful situations of interest but not yet an error.
ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
FATAL: Very severe error events that will lead the application to abort.
